# X Releases

X Releases is an app designed to help users keep up with releases by their favourite musical artists on Spotify. 

New album releases can be hard to keep track of, especially for less popular artists, and Spotify can be inconsistent with their release notifications. To overcome this, X Releases provides daily updates of releases based on a customizable list of a user's favourite artists, helping them discover the music they want to hear.
